                <figcaption>Each day I prayed for my husband to love me again.After fifteen years together, he walked away from me, and into the arms of another.I didn‚Äôt know how to cope. I didn‚Äôt know my worth. I didn‚Äôt know how to exist without him by my side.All I wanted was for him to come back to me.Then, Jackson Emery appeared.He was supposed to be a distraction for my mind. A summer fling. A confidence boost to my bruised heart.We were perfect for one another, because we both knew we wouldn‚Äôt last. Jackson didn‚Äôt believe in commitment, and I no longer believed in love. He was too closed-off for me, and I was too damaged for him.Everything was fine, until one night my heart skipped a beat.I didn‚Äôt expect him to make me laugh. To make me think. To make my sadness somewhat disappear.When our time was up, my heart didn‚Äôt know how to walk away.Each day I prayed for my husband to love me again, yet slowly my prayers began to shift toward the man who wasn‚Äôt right for me. I prayed for one more smile, one more kiss, one more laugh, one more touch‚Ä¶ I prayed for him to be mine.Even though I knew his heart wasn‚Äôt destined to love.

                <figcaption>Lowen Ashleigh is a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin when she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.

                    Lowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity‚Äôs notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn‚Äôt expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of the night her family was forever altered.
                     
                    Lowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents could devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen‚Äôs feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife‚Äôs words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue loving her.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>If she wasn‚Äôt dead already, Delphie would be dying of embarrassment. Not only did she just die by choking on a microwaveable burger, but now she‚Äôs standing in her ‚Äòshine like a star‚Äô nightie in front of the hottest man she‚Äôs ever seen. And he‚Äôs smiling at her.

                        As they start to chat, everything else becomes background noise. That is until someone comes running out of a door, yelling something about a huge mistake, and sends the dreamy stranger back down to earth. And here Delphie was thinking her luck might be different in the afterlife.  
                        
                        When Delphie is offered a deal in which she can return to earth and reconnect with the mysterious man, she jumps at the opportunity to find her possible soulmate and a fresh start. But in a city of millions, Delphie is going to have to listen to her heart, learn to ask for help, and perhaps even see the magic in the life she‚Äôs leaving behind‚Ä¶</figcaption>
